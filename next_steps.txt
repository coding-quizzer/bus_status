Fix Problems
✅ Make sure buses are empty when they are finished.
Make sure overflow passengers are dealt with
✅ Fix duplicate passenger issue
✅ Get Program to run to the end
Deal with passengers that have nowhere to go
Add visited locations to visited locations list
Somehow make the number of buses setable
Make sure the program always ends when the location distances are variable

Add features/Experiment
  Customizable bus size (should be =)
  Allow passengers to enter the system mid-program
  Convert time tick to a message

  

Refactoring

Tests
  Create tests ensuring all the passengers get to their destination
  Perhaps a whole bunch of passengers with the same route with a whole bunch of buses with the same route
   - make sure they all go to the same destination
  Testing Engine
    - use command arguments

  Write a list of tests

  Tests - things to check
    current asserts
      - passengers are never added to a station more than once
      - finished buses have no passengers remaining
      - invalid locations in the input data are rejected
      - all the passengers are accounted for -- passengers never disappear from the system
      - a bus neverenters a station that it is already docked at (no duplicate buses in the same station)
      - when a passenger arrives at their final destination, that destination will always be the location they want to get to (or trapped in the station if no buses are available to take them further)
      - any time a bus needs to depart from a particular station, the bus was already at that station in the first place

    Other tests
    - when a passenger transfers between buses, the passenger is removed from the bus and the station and is on the desired bus
    - overflowed passengers recalculate their schedule (their is currently a unit test for the schedule maker that accounts for overflowed buses)
    - after a bus is full, passengers still at the station do not have a schedule that requires taking that bus on that time tick
